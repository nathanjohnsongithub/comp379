Where I will store all of my work from Comp 379, Machine learning

The file `train.csv` is needed to run some of the code for hw1 and hw2. It is from the titanic dataset. You can download it from kaggle.

To run any python file first navigate to the homework you want to run 
```
cd hw1
```
Then create a venv
```
python -m venv .venv
```
Then install the requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
After that activate the env
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then run whichever file you want
```
python3 hw1.py
```
